[PCA9685 Multiple Servo Control using Arduino](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/pca9685-multiple-servo-control-using-arduino) - Tutorial on controlling multiple servos using PCA9685 with Arduino.

## 🧰 Components
- Arduino Uno R3
- 8 * SG90 Servo Motor
- PCA9685 16-Channel Module
- External 5v-Adaptor
- Jumper Wires

## 📜 Brief 
Most of us might ever use the Arduino Uno but the problem arises when connecting more than six Pwm-controlled devices with it. This problem can be easily resolved by this handy and beginner-friendly device named PCA9685 Module. In this project, we will step by step learn about the specifications of this module for connection, programming, and circuit diagram. Also, we can provide a video tutorial for better understanding.
